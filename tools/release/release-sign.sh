# X.Y.Z defaults to the version HEAD declares. KEY is K, or R in a recovery: both pass or fail the
# same checks, against the keys this tag and the previous release pin. It runs again for the
# companion el8-vX.Y.Z when el8.yml has finished later than release.yml.
#
# Nothing is signed unless your HEAD, GitHub's main, GitHub's tag and the attestation of the sums
# file all name one commit, and every job of the run the attestation names ran on GitHub's own
# machines: the attestation is made after the build, and says nothing of where the build ran. That
# rests on GitHub itself being sound, and an account on it being what may be lost: an account cannot
# get GitHub to attest a file for a commit that did not build it. The attested sums then vouch for
# every other file. What that commit holds is the admin's to know, so this is only as good as what
# they pulled into main.
#
# The draft is read again before the signature is uploaded and before it is published: whoever
# holds the account has as long as the prompts take.
#
# The audit runs first, and again after publishing, when the record has the new release. Exit
# status: 0 done, 1 refused, 2 usage.
