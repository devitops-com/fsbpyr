# previous-release.sh vX.Y.Z — the published release vX.Y.Z with the highest version below the
# given one, or nothing if there is none. Published: GitHub lists it, every page of it, and it is
# neither a draft nor a prerelease. Only names vX.Y.Z count, so a companion el8-vX.Y.Z never does,
# and versions compare as numbers: as text, v0.9.0 sorts above v0.30.0.
#
# Not from git, which does not say which tags were published: a release that failed keeps its tag
# and the version is burned, and only a published release has users, whose pins a new release must
# pass. release.yml's and el8.yml's sign jobs and check-release.sh use this. GH_TOKEN, a read-only
# token, is optional. FSBPYR_RELEASES_API replaces GitHub in tests. Needs curl and jq. Exit 0, or
# 2 if the list cannot be read: a lookup that goes wrong must stop a release, not skip a check.
