# release.sh — release the version main's HEAD declares: tag HEAD and push the tag.
#
#     bash tools/release/release.sh [X.Y.Z]        (make release [VERSION=X.Y.Z])
#
# HEAD is the release commit that `make release-prep` (prepare.sh) made at the end of a branch,
# merged into main by its pull request. That push to main ran full-suite.yml, which built and
# checked exactly this commit, the release build included. Nothing is built or tested here,
# and no release is created here: the pushed tag triggers .github/workflows/release.yml, which
# builds the executables from the tag (build.yml, without its checks), attests them (GitHub
# artifact attestations can only be made inside GitHub Actions) and publishes the GitHub
# release. This script follows that run (follow-run.sh: a line per job started or finished)
# and prints the release URL. X.Y.Z, if given, must be the version HEAD declares.
#
# Guards (all must pass before the tag is made): the three versions agree (version-files.sh)
# and equal X.Y.Z, on `main`, clean working tree (untracked files and assume-unchanged /
# skip-worktree entries included), local == hub/main, neither the tag nor the GitHub release
# exists yet, the CHANGELOG has the version's section and an empty [Unreleased] one (a change
# merged after the release commit would ship without being in the notes), and a successful
# full-suite.yml run for HEAD's push to main (a run in progress is waited for).
#
# Non-interactive use: set FSBPYR_RELEASE_ASSUME_YES=1 to skip the prompt.
# FSBPYR_RELEASE_WATCH_WAIT: how many seconds to wait for the tag's workflow run
# to show up (default 60); without one, the script says where to follow it and
# still succeeds.
