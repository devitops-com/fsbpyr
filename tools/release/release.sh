# It tags and builds (release-assets.sh: the audit, the tag, release.yml), waits for el8.yml, signs
# and publishes (release-sign.sh, which shows what it will sign, asks once and takes the passphrase
# once), checks the release as its users get it (make release-check) and publishes the wiki (make
# wiki-publish), and GitLab follows (mirror.sh). Run it again after any stop: what is done is left
