# release pins, for the fsbpyr that updates to it (docs/signing.md §5.3). SOURCE is a checkout that
# has both tags; PREVIOUS comes from previous-release.sh, and is empty if there is no such release.
#
# A tag's pins are the .pub files in src/fsbpyr/release-keys/ at that tag. Only the version named in
# tools/release/first-signed-release may have a previous release that pins nothing: for any other,
# that means the lookup went wrong, and a check that is skipped must stop the release. The sign jobs
# and check-release.sh run this, and the admin does in a recovery. Exit status: 0 VERIFIED, 1 NOT
# VERIFIED, 2 anything else, as release-signing.sh's.
